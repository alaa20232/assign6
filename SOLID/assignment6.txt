explain what code do
Employee: This class stores basic information about the employee, such as name, age, and position , include function hireEmployee , fireEmployee , printDetails and calculatePay 
that violate solid principle "Single Responsibility Principle" and "Open/Closed Principle" so we separate each of them into its own class inherite from base class Employee 
class manager also violate "Single Responsibility Principle" so we also separate its function into classes 
class Report violate "Interface Segregation Principle" includes a set of unrelated functions such as printing, saving, deleting, and sending so we separate 
its function and inherite from abstract class Report 
class PayrollSystem violate "Single Responsibility Principle" so separate its functions 
class logger also violate so we also separate its function into classes inherite from abstract class logger
